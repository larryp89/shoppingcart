        <p>
          Born in a fever dream after our founder watched too many nature
          documentaries while wearing their grandfather's vintage smoking
          jacket, we're the clothing brand for those who take their style
          seriously but themselves... not so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission? To create clothing that makes you look like you just
          stepped out of a Wes Anderson film, if Wes Anderson directed
          documentaries about Antarctic birds who discovered artisanal coffee.
          Think tailored blazers with hidden pockets perfect for storing your
          sourdough starter, and shirts so crisp they could have been ironed by
          a particularly meticulous emperor penguin
        </p>
        <p>
          Established in a converted ice cream parlor (because where else would
          a stoned penguin hang out?), we've grown from a small fleet of
          well-dressed birds into a global waddle of fashion revolutionaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our design philosophy is simple: What would happen if penguins
          discovered thrift stores and started a underground jazz club? Every
          piece in our collection is ethically sourced, sustainably produced,
          and approved by our focus group of imaginary antarctic socialites.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use only the finest materials, like organic cotton so soft it makes
          actual penguin down jealous, and buttons carved from sustainably
          harvested ice cubes (okay, that last part isn't true, but wouldn't it
          be cool?).

// Join our colony of fashionable misfits. Because life's too short to blend in with the other birds.
// Stoned Penguin: For those who rock the black tie affair, even when they're just getting the mail.
// (P.S. No penguins were intoxicated in the making of this brand. They're just naturally this chill.)
